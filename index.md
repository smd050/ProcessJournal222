# DES222 Task 2 Process Journal 
### Sean De Guzman - 1171469

# Introduction
This design process journal aims to record my decision making and thought process throughout the creation of an interactive website or at least a context aware innovation. 

# Initial Ideas
The first two ideas that came to mind were an interactive drawing app then a recreational activity tracker app. 

![Badly Drawn Sketch of Idea](images/Concepts.jpg)

The web app uses geological coordinates and a user input, (either from the a mobile phone itself or an external hardware such as the microbit) to draw digital lines around the sorrounding environment.

Second to that is  a web app that is context aware of the user's geological location. On top of that the web app can track the user's speed and tilt or lean angle as this app is heavily influenced for motorcycle riders who want to keep track of their activities.

# Research
From here on, the vr drawing app will be referred to as "option 1, design 1, or digital drawing app" and the recreational activity tracker app will be referred to as "option 2, design 2, or GeoTrack onwards.

After some research about VR videos for option one, there came the trouble of finding a way to make the one screen video into two split screen video that is fitting for the VR headset to be used.

Further research later, i find the whole idea of splitscreens in vr headsets confusing and a bit too much. Moreover the resources required including a data storage for drawings or probably lenses and 3d printing materials is far beyond my reach so I have given up on it for now.

For the design 2, it was fairly easy to find APIs after searching 'camera access' and hit either the first result or scroll a few bits to avoid unnecessary paid content.

Should the camera capture be able to adjust itself with the settings a action camera or dslr camera have? Hard no, I am not doing that as long as the main functions would work as fine, luxiries does not matter at this point for now.

# Inspirations
Even before the idea of GeoView Web App, some similar stuff were already made for other specific products. There was this one third-party web app that can tap into a GoPro 11 camera and access its geolocation and add speedometer overlay while it records.

Found it, its some sort of telemetry thing:

It did not took me long to figure out Google also have the bubble thing to measure device orientation by googling 'bubble level' and it shows at the very top of the results.

It was noon on a Thursday, I forgot Toby went to Japan and there were no workshop this week, I had to wait for 2 hours wandering and enjoying air for the time being after my 8am - 10am class. Along the way, I wondered if features such as the wind would be a major factor or and important detail to be displayed for the design 2.

After arriving home the same day, Toby uploaded two pre-recorded episodes of 'Device Orientation API' and 'Media Capture API' and it was perfect. I have all the infinity stones to create something abominable. Weekly modules are time locked for students to view as well, I think.

# The Development Group
I paired up with Jay and Torin, with them approaching me and having a near similar interest to the project concept. Jay, has an interest working with back-end development. While just chatting after class, he is keen to further develop his skills and understanding of programming and software development. 

![Early Back-end stuff planning or discussion with Jay](images/BackendSketch.jpg)

Torin on the contrary, likes front-end development and design. He is generally broader and intuitive with the ideas he adds on top of the project which adds possible features and technicality along the way.

I personally don't mind either tasks as I have experience with them but not so often in groups. I see this as an opportunity to me to discover working with random people more and how to keep our ideals aligned or at least for the project to not incline to an overly unrealistic thing before the deadline.

# Setbacks
I generally plan things a week or two ahead and set a personal due date however, circumstances does not favor me at the moment by consistently being preoccupied by work, moving stuff and other assessments that are due sooner. 
![Sticky Notes: To Do List](images/Grind.jpg)

We paired up as a groupd back in week 7, it was Me and Torin at first, then Jay came along during week 9 which was better than being short handed. Communication was also dire at the very start, they were also preoccupied by other courses which is a hundred per cent understandable and everyone got personal lives, especially when week break hit.

Personally I am not fond with using python which was Jay's forte in programming langguage as i keep adding curly brackets or semicolons to the functions being a C# and java programming langguage habit.

Conflict of iterests also arises but not that severe, the idea started for motorcycles and it went into boats? However in a sense, the project also expanded covering mountainbiking, tool to avoid getting lost (Internet access required), and level bubble measuring tool which makes it flexible.


# Reflection (Week 10 From hereon out)
Immediately, I find this way of journaling or documenting amusing than traditional notebook and pens, it lets me add images and freely edit things on how I see fit. Truly revolutionary for my digital literacy. 

I tend to work alone and fixate on one thing at a time like the artefact itself, but process entry for breaks is refreshing and I can backtrack where and why things are going now, and will be aiming towards the future.

Working in groups had its ups and downs in my honest opinion, but it outweighs the negatives by having multiple people work on the same thing. In a way, it eases the workload while in return, everyone benefits from different perspectives and approaches to setbacks.



# Pre-Development
I added this because may be Jay and Torin's introduction to Model View Controller (MVC) web api project. This section will be mostly for the group's vision for the project design to align and tie down things altogether.

## Mock Design
Torin took heavy inspiration from the sketch we made weeks prior, we now have a blueprint or layout which will be done in an interactive HTML web page.

## Pseudocode
Me and Jay made pseudocode while Torin was making the mock design and some powerpoint presentation for next week.
